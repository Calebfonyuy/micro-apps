# Instructions for Claude Ai

## Project description 
This project aims at developing micro applications that can be used to manage punctual or repetitive tasks for my everyday activities. Each project should be in a dedicated folder. 

## Programming language. 

Use either bash scripts or python. Priviledge should be given to bash scripts and python can be used when the bash script becomes too long (more than 150 lines of code). 

## Other Guidelines
* Each project should have a Readme
* Create a .gitignore file in cases where this is applicable. 
* Create a setup.sh file to install necessary system packages where necessary. 
* In situations where tasks include distant management, use, ansible files that can then be launched either with bash scripts or python code.
